	I was born on May 12,1998, in Aguascalientes, Mexico. I have an older brother named Adrian, and a younger sister named Giselle. My mom is named Luz and my dad is named Panfilo. I travelled between the US and Mexico. I did a year of Kindergarden in Mexico, then another year of Kindergarden through 2nd Grade in the US. After that I completed 3rd and 4th grade in Mexico, 5th through 7th in the US. I did 8th, 9th and the 2 months of 10th Grade in Mexico, after that stuff really did hit the fan and I knew it before hand. I moved to the US after the 2 months of school and got put back into 9th for not having enough credits to be a sophomore at that time. The only good thing about moving here after that inccident is I am in the class that I like doing. Programing.

	I like to listen to rock music, my favorite colors are blue and black, I like to play the guitar, my favorite school subject is Math, I love playing Video Games, watch anime, and program. The first song, that I can remember listening to, is boulevard of broken dreams by Green Day when I was about 7 years old, my current favorite band is Avenged Sevenfold. I started playing the guitar last year. I played video games on the Nintendo 64, since my brother had one. Finally I got intersted in computers, how they work, and programing, is while the 2 months in 10th Grade, I had my first math homework, which was figure out how a "number guessing table" worked, and it was all done through binary.

For the future I am still not 100% sure what I am going to do, but I know that I am most likely to get a masters degree in Computer Science, and work for a big company, unless don't live long enough for that. I would like to go into the video game development, where I get to be around what I love doing.
